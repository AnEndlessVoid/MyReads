# MyReads Project

This is a React App which allows you to manipulate a list of books. The user can put books in categories (Currently reading, Want to Read and Finished Reading) as well as delete the book from the list. The user can also use a search page which allows him to add books to the list.

# How to run
1. You will need npm. If you have Node installed you have npm as well. If you don't have node, then install it from here https://nodejs.org/en/.

2. Run npm install and then npm start. The second command will open a browser window on localhost:3000, which will have the app running.
